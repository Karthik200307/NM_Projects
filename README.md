# Online Food Ordering App using Mern stack 

1. Introduction

Project Title: Online Food Ordering

Team Members:

- R Karthikeyan (Frontend)

- Imran Sheriff H (Style and Design)

- Deva R (Backend)

- Gokul (Database)

2. Project Overview

Purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly online food ordering app using the MERN stack

(MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The app aims to simplify the food ordering process by allowing

users to browse menus, place orders, and make payments directly through the platform.

Key Goals:

- Enhanced User Experience: Creating an intuitive, responsive interface where users can easily search for

restaurants, view menus, customize orders, and track delivery.

- Efficient Order Management: Enabling restaurant partners to receive, manage, and process orders in real

time, streamlining their operations.

- Secure Payment Integration: Providing a safe and seamless checkout process with payment gateway

integration.

- Scalable & Robust Backend: Ensuring data security and speed with a well-structured backend and MongoDB for handling large numbers of orders and user data efficiently.

- Customer Engagement Features: Adding features like order history, notifications, and reviews to keep users

engaged and improve customer retention.

3. Architecture

Frontend: 

Built with React, which manages the app's user interface, state, and routing. Components include restaurant

browsing, cart management, and order tracking.

Backend: 

Node.js and Express.js handle server logic, routing, and API management. RESTful APIs facilitate

communication between frontend and backend.

Database: 

MongoDB is used as the primary database to store user data, restaurant menus, orders, and reviews, with a

schema designed for high efficiency and scalability.

4. Setup Instructions

Prerequisites: Node.js, MongoDB

Installation: 1. Clone the repository. 2. Navigate to the project root directory. 3. Install dependencies with npm

install for both frontend and backend. 4. Set up environment variables (e.g., database connection URI, JWT

secret). 5. Start MongoDB.

5. Folder Structure

Client: Contains all React components, services, and utilities for the frontend.
Server: Houses backend services, controllers, models, and routes in a structured manner to organize

server-side logic.

6. Running the Application

Frontend: Run npm start in the client directory.

Backend: Run npm start in the server directory.

7. API Documentation

Each API endpoint includes:

- Request Method: (GET, POST, etc.)

- Endpoint: URL path

- Parameters: Inputs required

- Example Responses: Sample JSON responses for various endpoints

8. Authentication

Authentication is managed using JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to protected routes and resources.

JWT tokens are generated upon login and stored on the client side for session management.
